Me:
Hello Sarah. It has been a while! How have you been? How’s the new job going?

Sarah:
Hello Eleanor Yes, it has really been a while. The job is going well, but it is a whole lot. I am still trying to get used to the new routine. I have been so busy, but I am managing.

Me:
Oh that us good to hear! And how is the family? How are the kids doing?

Sarah:
They are doing well, but you know how it is. They are growing so fast! My youngest child started kindergarten recently, and my older one is keeping me on my toes with all his after-school assignment. There is always something to do.

Me:
Wow, I am sure that’s a lot to handle. Between the new job and the kids, it must feel like exhausting. How are you holding up with everything?

Sarah:
Honestly, it is a bit overwhelming. I am constantly running around from one thing to the other. Some days I wonder how I am going to get everything done, and I am just so exhausted. It is hard to keep up with it everything sometimes.

Me:
I can only imagine. It sounds like there is a lot on your plate. You know, I have also been dealing with some stress lately and i discovered that the Bible actually has a lot of practical advice for times like this. 

Sarah:
Really?

Me:
Yes. The bible tells us exactly how to deal with stress and how to find peace, even when things get really busy. Have you ever thought about looking into what the Bible says about managing stress and finding balance?

Sarah:
Not really. With everything going on, I have not had the time to do that.

Me:
I totally understand you. Life can be so busy, and finding time for something like that can be challenging. But there is a website called jw.org that has some really helpful articles and videos on managing stress and balancing family life. Would you be interested in checking it out when you get a chance?

Sarah:
Definitely.

Me:
The website has all kinds of practical advice for you. For example, there’s an article titled "How to Deal With Stress” and it gives tips on coping with anxiety even when life becomes overwhelming. The website also has videos that explain how to apply Bible principles to everyday situations. And the best part? It is all really simple to use.
